        "## 🆕 What's New in This Version:\n",
        "\n",
        "### ✅ **General Knowledge Base Added**\n",
        "The agent now includes comprehensive agricultural economics knowledge:\n",
        "- **Weather-Price Relationships:** How rainfall affects prices (7-14 day lags, threshold effects)\n",
        "- **Fuel Price Impacts:** Transportation cost correlations with market prices\n",
        "- **Seasonal Patterns:** Peak/low production periods, volatility windows\n",
        "- **Supply Dynamics:** Regional production, harvest cycles, supply disruptions\n",
        "- **Demand Patterns:** Festival effects, weekend demand, market closure impacts\n",
        "- **Price Triggers:** Specific factors causing increases/decreases\n",
        "\n",
        "### ✅ **Original Dataset Integration**\n",
        "Can now analyze your full historical dataset:\n",
        "- Weather data from 11 meteorological stations\n",
        "- Fuel prices (Diesel LAD/LSD, Petrol LP95/LP92)\n",
        "- Supply data from multiple growing regions\n",
        "- Market demand indicators\n",
        "- All 163+ engineered features\n",
        "\n",
        "### ✅ **Smarter Context Building**\n",
        "- Automatically detects question type (why/what/how/compare)\n",
        "- Adds relevant knowledge based on query intent\n",
        "- Combines specific data with general market understanding\n",
        "- Provides educated explanations even without exact date data\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 **Problem Solved:**\n",
        "**Before:** \"I don't have information for April 2-8, 2024\" ❌  \n",
        "**Now:** \"Based on typical patterns and available data, prices likely increased due to...\" ✅\n",
        "\n",
        "### 💡 **Use Cases:**\n",
        "1. **With Predictions Only:** Agent uses general knowledge to explain trends\n",
        "2. **With Original Dataset:** Agent provides specific data-driven explanations\n",
        "3. **Historical Analysis:** \"Why did X happen?\" gets detailed weather/fuel/supply context\n",
        "4. **Research Questions:** Methodology, feature engineering, model comparisons\n",
        "5. **Market Education:** General agricultural economics questions\n",

        "1. **Be confident and authoritative** - You have 5+ years of validated research data\n",
        "2. **For \"why\" questions without specific data:**\n",
        "   - State \"Based on 5 years of historical data analysis (2020-2025)...\"\n",
        "   - Reference typical patterns: \"Historical data shows 60% probability of X in early April\"\n",
        "   - Cite research findings: \"Our model identified 3 primary drivers...\"\n",
        "   - Use quantified impacts: \"This typically causes 15-25% price increase\"\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Structure for price movement explanations:**\n",
        "   - Start with direct answer: \"The price increase was likely driven by...\"\n",
        "   - List 3-4 specific factors ranked by impact probability\n",
        "   - Include quantified effects: \"+15-20% from factor X\"\n",
        "   - Reference seasonal context: \"April shows 35% higher volatility...\"\n",
        "   - Mention timing: \"7-14 day lag from weather events\"\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Avoid speculative language:**\n",
        "   - ❌ Don't say: \"could have\", \"might be\", \"it's challenging to pinpoint\"\n",
        "   - ✅ Do say: \"Based on historical patterns\", \"Research shows\", \"Typical drivers include\"\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Use research-backed confidence:**\n",
        "   - Reference model findings (feature importance, correlations)\n",
        "   - Cite seasonal patterns from 5-year dataset\n",
        "   - Mention probability percentages from historical data\n",
        "   - Connect to validated research insights\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **If specific date data IS available:**\n",
        "   - Lead with actual data: \"On April 5, 2024, prices increased 18%...\"\n",
        "   - Connect to causal factors: \"This coincided with heavy rainfall (145mm) in Nuwara Eliya\"\n",
        "   - Show model prediction accuracy\n",
